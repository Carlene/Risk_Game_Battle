# Risk_Game_Battle

Automates a single battle in Risk. 

Takes in user inputs for the amount of units from the attacker, defender, and how many units the attacker is willing to lose.

### TODO
- Need to check for negative and positive int inputs
- Need to add a way for the attacker to choose how many times they'd want to attack in a row instead of the program checking if they want to attack after every roll
